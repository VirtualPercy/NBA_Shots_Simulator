# 🏀 NBA Shot Outcome Simulator

This project simulates NBA shot outcomes using a combination of real-world player data and a randomized probability-based shot generator. It was completed as part of a graduate-level data programming course at UW–Madison.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Using data on NBA players and shot attribution, this notebook creates a simulator that predicts the likely outcome of a shot attempt based on player attributes such as 3-point percentage, field goal rate, and role. The final tool allows a user to simulate multiple shots and compare success rates across players.
